What‚Äôs inside the ZIP

- Frontend: index.php, about.php, services.php, projects.php, contact.php

- Admin panel: admin/login.php, dashboard.php, CRUD for Services, Projects, Slides, and Inquiries

- Assets: assets/css/style.css, assets/js/script.js, assets/images/ (upload target)

- DB config: includes/db.php (update credentials for your server)

- SQL dump: construction.sql (creates DB + tables + default admin)

Quick start

1. Extract to your web root (e.g., htdocs/construction_site).

2. Create a database and import construction.sql via phpMyAdmin.

3. Edit includes/db.php with your host‚Äôs MySQL credentials.

4. Make sure assets/images/ is writable for uploads.

5. Admin login: username: admin / password: 12345 (please change it).

If you want, I can harden this to production standards (prepared statements, file-type validation, CSRF tokens, stronger password hashing like password_hash()), or tailor the branding/design to a specific construction company.
